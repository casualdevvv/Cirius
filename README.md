# Cirius/Citrus
A open source rescripted version of Sirius by Shlex (https://discord.gg/sirius)


## FAQ

#### How was this made? 

Shlex has open source models available on his roblox account so I decided to rescript the UI of Sirius found in his inventory

#### Is this free?

Yes! While the original script is paid, we are not afiliated with Sirius in any way, shape, or form, and made it completely open source!
